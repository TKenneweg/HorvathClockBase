Things that are working: 
- Identification of relevant data
- Downloading of raw data
- Preprocessing of raw data into pickeld pytorch tensors 
- Fast Pytorch dataset creation from these tensors
- MLP Training with this data with reasonable results 
- Calculation of horvaths results on train data
- Simple linear regression of methylation data without regularization
- visualization of transformation function 
- visualization of results as scatter plot and histogram
- plot of regression coefficients 
- using regularization in regression and see how many coefficients are non zero



What is missing: 
- Calculation of horvaths results on test data
- application of transformation function on age data for regression
- generation of loss graphs for mlp case.
